SimpleHero Strategy
===========================================
Simplehero follows a basic greedy strategy to collect eatables. It lookes for the
next closest eatable, and if it can reach every other eatable from where it's at,
then it goes to it, otherwise it looks for the next nearest eatable that all other
eatables can be reached from and eats that instead.

Files
===========================================
README:
-------
This README.


Makefile:
---------
The Makefile contained in the project contains three sections as described below. 

1. all command     - This is the default make command to compile all of the
                     programs normally. CXXFLAGS includes -g for debugging.
					 This may be removed.
2. clean command   - This will clean out all object files created by 'make all'.
					 Object files created by Prof. Stolee will remain.
3. tarball command - This will make a tarball from the source files for
                     submission.


simplehero.cpp:
---------------
simplehero.cpp contains the implementation of the SimpleHero class.

Additional private methods created were findPath and getEatables which found a
path to the specified vertex and created a list of all of the remaining eatables
on the map. Additional information and descriptions can be found in simplehero.hpp.


simplehero.hpp:
---------------
simplehero.hpp contains the class definition for the simplehero class.

See simplehero.hpp for additional details on methods.


ssbros.cpp:
-----------
ssbros.cpp contains the main method for the program. See 'Additional Features'
for more details.


Additional Freatures
===========================================
ssbros includes some additional command line arguments that are available.

-t, --timer
	Times how long it takes for the program to execute.
